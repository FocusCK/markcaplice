            <p class="artist">Mark’s debut hit single “Catch a Tear” was accompanied by a truly inventive video captured by Kodaline’s Jason Boland in 2021, whilst the popular follow-up single titled “All In Your Head” (2022) was recorded in U2’s Windmill Lane and features Elbow’s drummer Rick Jupp behind an infectious, hook-filled anthem. Both singles received extensive support across Irish and U.K. radio including live interviews and performances on RTÉ Radio 1 and BBC Scotland.</p>
            <p class="artist">Following on from this success - Just before the close of 2022, Mark’s music caught the attention of The Recording Academy/GRAMMYs who invited him to be a featured guest on their Reimagined At Home series, which asks artists to record their favourite GRAMMY-winning song. Mark delivered a truly unique and stirring cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain” on piano accompanied by a brass ensemble and atmospheric percussion. The video received over 10,000 views in 24 hours catching the attention of Fleetwood Mac’s guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, as well as members of The Lumineers and Sam Fender’s band.</p>
            <p class="artist">This summer will see the release of his new EP “Brighter Side Of Sorrow” alongside his first headline London show, amongst many more live dates to be announced.</p>
